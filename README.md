OpenVPN is a VPN package, in order to make a connection to your resources on a private network. To add another layer of security, we’re adding a 2FA mechanism for each user. They will login as usual, but will need to use a time-based token (provided by the Authy app on their phone) to login to company’s networks.

To install it, download these files or clone this repo.
